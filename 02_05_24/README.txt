The main file of interest is 'mdanalysis.ipynb', where all of the operations are performed.

Note: The program does what is intended to do, however I have a problem with the radial pair distribution values of the simulations that I have performed using AutoIMD.
That is why the resulting 3D plot shows apparent wrong values for those temperatures.
