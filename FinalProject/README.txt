Final project of the subject: Nanometric Systems Simulation
Title: A Real-time Molecular Dynamics Simulation

Only main.cpp has been uploaded in order to understand the workflow of the program. The code is neither polished nor optimised yet, as this was not the main focus of the project.
Since this file alone is not enough to replicate the executable, contact brunopalomar70@gmail.com if interested in further details or instructions on how to run the program on your machine. Thank you.
